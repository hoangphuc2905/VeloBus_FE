Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### yarn start
Starts the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

### yarn test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### yarn eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.# VeloBus_FE
